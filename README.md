# bfc

*bfc* is a bad (probably) [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) compiler. 

It compiles only to *x64* assembly, though there are flags that you can use to get your code assembled and linked into a standard Linux elf executable.

I wrote this compiler because I had no idea how to write compilers, and thought it might be interesting. It was very interesting and I still have close to no idea how to write compilers, because Brainfuck is a very syntactically simple language. I'll be working on a C compiler next.

## Install

Build it yourself this time, sorry. I'm lazy.
